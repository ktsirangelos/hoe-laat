# hoe laat

An app that answers the question: what does "I'll be there at 7" actually mean?

## The Problem

We all have that friend who thinks "on time" means "within the same hour":
- The perpetually late buddy who's always "just around the corner" for 30 minutes
- The colleague who interprets "9 AM meeting" as a gentle suggestion
- Your sibling who says they're "ready to go" but hasn't even started looking for their shoes

Rather than fight this fundamental law of human nature, *hoe laat* turns it into data.

## The Idea

Time is relative, especially when humans are involved. Don't try to fix people - just predict their actual behavior so you can plan accordingly.

## How It Works

1. **Reality Check**\
   The app builds profiles so when someone says "8:00," you'll know if that's an actual 8:00 or more like 8:47.

2. **Mirror Mirror**\
   Find out if you're actually as punctual as you think you are (spoiler: probably not).

3. **Friend Groups**\
   Make appointments with many people at the same time and register their arrivals individually.

4. **Backward Planning**\
   Need everyone there by 3:00? The app tells you what time to tell each person.

5. **Location Tracking**\
   Location check-in system because no one wants to fill out a spreadsheet for their social life.

## Next up

- Trend tracking (is someone getting later or earlier?)
- Season factors (quick conclusions? everyone's later when it rains...)

## Tech Stuff

Built with Ruby on Rails, Turbo and Stimulus for interactivity, and Tailwind CSS for styling. Working toward PWA functionality.

## Is this a joke?

I guess so. I don't know, maybe not :]
